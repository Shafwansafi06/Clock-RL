## ðŸš€ Features

- **Self-tuning alarms**: The app learns from your behavior and adjusts alarm times automatically
- **Visual adjustments**: See how much the algorithm has adjusted your alarms compared to your original settings
- **Snooze management**: Configure snooze intervals and limits for each alarm
- **Learning dashboard**: View statistics about your wake-up patterns and how the system is learning
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive interface with smooth animations

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Set up alarms with your desired wake-up times
2. When an alarm rings, dismiss it or snooze
3. The app records your actual wake-up time and uses it to calculate rewards
4. The Q-learning algorithm adjusts future alarm times based on your patterns
5. Over time, the system learns your optimal wake-up schedule

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Q-learning for reinforcement learning
- Styled Components
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Icons

## ðŸš€ Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shafwansafi06/Clock-RL.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Clock-RL

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## ðŸ“Š Learning Algorithm

Clock-RL uses Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to make decisions by trying different actions and evaluating their outcomes. The system:

- Learns from your wake-up behavior
- Adjusts alarms earlier or later as needed
- Considers factors like snooze frequency
- Optimizes for timely wake-ups

## ðŸ”œ Future Improvements

- Sound customization for alarms
- Sleep quality tracking integration
- Dark/light theme options
- Multiple profiles for different users
- Weekly and monthly sleep pattern reports
