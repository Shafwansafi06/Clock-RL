# Pushing Clock-RL to GitHub

There are several methods you can use to push your project to GitHub. The issue you're experiencing is likely related to token permissions or expiration.

## Option 1: Create a New Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give it a name like "Clock-RL Push"
4. Set expiration as needed
5. Select your repository or "All repositories"
6. Under "Repository permissions", give "Contents" at least "Write" access
7. Generate token and copy it
8. Edit the `push_to_github.sh` script and replace "YOUR_NEW_TOKEN" with the new token
9. Run: `./push_to_github.sh`

## Option 2: Set Up SSH (Recommended for Long-Term)

```bash
# Generate an SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "Shafwansafi06@gmail.com"

# Start the SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Print your public key (add this to GitHub)
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Then add this key to GitHub:
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
2. Paste your key and give it a title
3. Click "Add SSH key"

Finally, update your remote and push:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Shafwansafi06/Clock-RL.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Push from GitHub Web Interface

If the above methods don't work, you can push directly from the GitHub web interface:

1. Go to https://github.com/Shafwansafi06/Clock-RL
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop your project files or select them from your computer
4. Add a commit message and commit the changes

## Option 4: Use GitHub CLI

If you install GitHub CLI, you can authenticate and push more easily:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
sudo apt install gh

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Push repository
gh repo create Clock-RL --public --source=. --push
```
